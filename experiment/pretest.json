        "D": "All provide both multiplexing and diversity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! MIMO can provide both diversity and multiplexing gain, while SIMO/MISO primarily offer diversity gain.",
        "B": "Incorrect. SIMO/MISO do not provide multiplexing gain.",
        "C": "Incorrect. MIMO can provide both gains, not just multiplexing.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. Rank(H) is not simply the sum of the number of antennas.",
        "B": "Correct! The maximum possible rank of the channel matrix is min(Mt, Mr).",
        "C": "Incorrect. The maximum is the minimum of the two antenna counts, not the maximum.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! In SVD, U and V are complex unitary matrices.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Hermitian matrices are equal to their conjugate transpose, which is not the case here.",
        "C": "Incorrect. They are generally complex, not purely real.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. The number of rows in S is not the same as the number of non-zero entries.",
        "B": "Incorrect. The number of transmit antennas does not directly determine this.",
        "C": "Correct! The number of non-zero singular values equals rank(H).",
        "D": "Incorrect. Mr × Mt is the total number of elements, not non-zero singular values."

        "D": "All antennas must be omnidirectional"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. Having fewer receive antennas can actually limit spatial multiplexing.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Spatial multiplexing can also work in frequency-selective channels with proper processing.",
        "C": "Correct! Full rank ensures multiple independent spatial streams for multiplexing.",
        "D": "Incorrect. Antenna directionality is not the primary factor."

        "A": "It always improves reliability",
        "B": "It only works with single antenna systems",
        "C": "It increases capacity linearly with the number of antennas under ideal conditions",
        "D": "It is independent of channel state information"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. Spatial multiplexing improves data rate, not necessarily reliability.",
        "B": "Incorrect. It requires multiple antennas.",
        "C": "Correct! Under ideal full-rank and high-SNR conditions, capacity scales linearly with the number of antennas.",
        "D": "Incorrect. CSI is often needed at least at the receiver for decoding."

      "question": "Which of the following are TRUE about the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff?",
      "answers": {
        "A": "MIMO systems only provide multiplexing gain",

        "C": "Diversity gain can be achieved without any loss in multiplexing gain",
        "D": "Diversity gain will enhance multiplexing gain"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. MIMO can provide both gains, but not simultaneously at maximum levels.",
        "B": "Correct! Increasing diversity generally reduces achievable multiplexing gain due to the tradeoff.",
        "C": "Incorrect. There is usually a tradeoff — increasing one reduces the other.",
        "D": "Incorrect. Diversity and multiplexing gains compete rather than enhance each other."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. This is indeed a drawback — rich scattering is often required.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Channel correlation can indeed reduce spatial multiplexing performance.",
        "C": "Correct! In high SNR, spatial multiplexing actually increases data rate, not reduces it.",
