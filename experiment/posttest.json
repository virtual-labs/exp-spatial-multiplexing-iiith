    "question": "After pre-processing and post-processing using SVD, what happens to the MIMO system?",
    "options": [
      "It works as an effective combining technique providing diversity gain",
      "It decomposes the channel into rank(H) parallel independent channels",
      "Since it involves multiplying input and output by a weight vector, it leads to increased power (array gain)",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "answer": "It decomposes the channel into rank(H) parallel independent channels",
    "explanation": "SVD diagonalizes the MIMO channel into rank(H) orthogonal subchannels, each behaving as an independent SISO link."
  },
  {
    "question": "Given H = [[1, 1], [1, -1]] × [[5, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0]] × [[1, 1, 0], [1, -1, 4], [2, -2, 1]], how many independent parallel streams can be formed?",
    "options": ["1", "2", "3", "Cannot be determined from given info"],
    "answer": "2",
    "explanation": "The middle diagonal matrix shows two non-zero singular values, so the channel rank is 2, allowing 2 independent streams."
  },
  {
    "question": "Find the rank of the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 2], [1, 4, 5]].",
    "options": ["1", "2", "3", "None of the above"],
    "answer": "2",
    "explanation": "Row 3 is a linear combination of Row 1 and Row 2, so there are only 2 independent rows."
  },
  {
    "question": "Find the rank of the matrix [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]].",
    "options": ["1", "2", "3", "None of the above"],
    "answer": "3",
    "explanation": "This is the 3×3 identity matrix, which has full rank (rank = 3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Find the SVD of the matrix [[3, 0], [4, 5]].",
    "options": [
      "U = [[0.6, -0.8], [0.8, 0.6]], Σ = [[5, 0], [0, 3]], Vᵀ = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]",
      "U = [[0.6, 0.8], [-0.8, 0.6]], Σ = [[6, 0], [0, 2]], Vᵀ = I",
      "Correct SVD values as computed",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "answer": "Correct SVD values as computed",
    "explanation": "The actual SVD yields specific orthonormal U, diagonal Σ with singular values, and orthonormal Vᵀ; neither of the first two options matches exactly."

  {
    "question": "Find the capacity of the above-given channel given that B = 10 Hz, the total power available at the transmitter is 10 dB, and the noise variance is 1.",
    "options": ["20 bps", "33.22 bps", "40 bps", "15 bps"],
    "answer": "33.22 bps",
    "explanation": "Using the MIMO capacity formula with given parameters and 10 dB (power = 10), the result is approximately 33.22 bits/s."
  },
  {
    "question": "In spatial multiplexing, what happens when the number of transmit antennas exceeds the number of receive antennas?",
    "options": [
      "All transmitted streams can always be reliably separated",
      "System capacity always increases linearly",
      "Some spatial streams may interfere with each other, degrading performance",
      "The receiver can ignore extra streams without any performance loss"
    ],
    "answer": "Some spatial streams may interfere with each other, degrading performance",
    "explanation": "If Nt > Nr, the extra streams cannot be fully separated, leading to inter-stream interference and reduced performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following MIMO techniques primarily exploits the spatial multiplexing gain rather than diversity gain?",
    "options": [
      "Alamouti scheme",
      "Space-time block coding",
      "Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST)",
      "Transmit diversity scheme"
    ],
    "answer": "Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST)",
    "explanation": "V-BLAST is designed for high data rate transmission by sending multiple independent streams, focusing on multiplexing gain rather than diversity."
