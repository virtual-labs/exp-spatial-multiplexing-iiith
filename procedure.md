To understand the concept of spatial multiplexing in a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, please follow the following steps :
  1) Enter the number of transmit and recieve antennas.
  2) Click on Simulate Channel.
  3) The system automatically geneates the antennas and displays the channel matrix.
  4) Click on perform SVD to visualize the singular value decomposition of the channel matrix.
  5) Click on visualize eigenbeams to see the parallel channels and their strengths.
  6) Repeat the experiment with different values of and analyze the changes in capacity.
