    {
      "question": "After pre-processing and post-processing using SVD, what happens to the MIMO system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It works as an effective combining technique providing diversity gain",
        "b": "It decomposes the channel into rank(H) parallel independent channels",
        "c": "Since it involves multiplying input and output by a weight vector, it leads to increased power (array gain)",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes diversity schemes, not SVD channel decomposition.",
        "b": "Correct. SVD diagonalizes the MIMO channel into rank(H) orthogonal subchannels, each behaving as an independent SISO link.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That effect is more related to beamforming/array gain.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The correct description is option b."

    {
      "question": "Given H = [[1, 1], [1, -1]] × [[5, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0]] × [[1, 1, 0], [1, -1, 4], [2, -2, 1]], how many independent parallel streams can be formed?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1",
        "b": "2",
        "c": "3",
        "d": "Cannot be determined from given info"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The diagonal matrix shows more than one non-zero singular value.",
        "b": "Correct. The middle diagonal matrix shows two non-zero singular values, so the channel rank is 2, allowing 2 independent streams.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Only two non-zero singular values exist.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The rank can be determined from the given SVD form."

      "question": "Find the SVD of the matrix [[3, 0], [4, 5]].",
      "answers": {
        "a": "U = [[0.6, -0.8], [0.8, 0.6]], Σ = [[5, 0], [0, 3]], Vᵀ = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]",
        "b": "U = [[0.6, 0.8], [-0.8, 0.6]], Σ = [[6, 0], [0, 2]], Vᵀ = I",
        "c": "Correct SVD values as computed",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. These numbers don't match the true SVD of [[3, 0], [4, 5]].",
        "b": "Incorrect. These values are not the correct singular values or vectors.",
        "c": "Correct. The actual SVD yields orthonormal U and Vᵀ with the true singular values.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is correct."

      "question": "Find the capacity of the above-given channel given that B = 10 Hz, the total power available at the transmitter is 10 dB, and the noise variance is 1.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "20 bps",
        "b": "33.22 bps",
        "c": "40 bps",
        "d": "15 bps"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This underestimates the capacity given the available SNR.",
        "b": "Correct. Using the MIMO capacity formula with given parameters and 10 dB (power = 10), the result is approximately 33.22 bits/s.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is larger than the computed value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is much smaller than the correct capacity."

    {
      "question": "In spatial multiplexing, what happens when the number of transmit antennas exceeds the number of receive antennas?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All transmitted streams can always be reliably separated",
        "b": "System capacity always increases linearly",
        "c": "Some spatial streams may interfere with each other, degrading performance",
        "d": "The receiver can ignore extra streams without any performance loss"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not possible without enough receive dimensions to separate streams.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Capacity increase saturates when Nt > Nr.",
        "c": "Correct. If Nt > Nr, the extra streams cannot be fully separated, leading to inter-stream interference and reduced performance.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Ignoring streams wastes capacity but doesn't avoid interference in most cases."
